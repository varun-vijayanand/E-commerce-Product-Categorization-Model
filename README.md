# Creating an E-commerce Product Categorization Model Using Deep Learning

Here, we build a predictive model to categorize products in an e-commerce data set to successfully classify product categories with high precision using state machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Methodology and Approach

* Image classification - There are images for every item mapped to a particular category. We need to train deep learning algorithms and use that machine to predict the category whenever there is a new image of the product.

* Text classification - multiclass text classification. Instead of images, we will consider the product description as features and product category as a label to build the classifier. 
We implement the multiclass text classification using different deep neural networks algorithms.
